Week 2 is finished and I have less to show than I would have liked. Still trying to get the hang of all of Android Studio's various features. I sketched out another plan for different app features and I've realized that there are a lot of different aspects to this project, including a group chat feature. 
I have started looking into Google Maps to see how I can incorporate that into my app, should be interesting. More info on that next time. I think I will be alotting more time per day to research and implementation, and less to other classes.
